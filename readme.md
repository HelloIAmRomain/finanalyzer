# Thanks for using Finanalyzer
-------------------------------
*Working on this program*

This program will automatically create and update a financial database.

The objective is to be able to analyze this data. I will try to create a neural network that analyses it and hopefully gives some interesting results.

The database is composed of three tables:

- [ ] List of tickers that links the name of the company, some additional information about it, and its UUID
- [ ] History of previous stocks values of the companies
- [ ] General financial data of a company
